// any write with ifGenerationMatch as safe to auto-retry, but it can't tell
// "this already succeeded, the response just got lost" apart from "this
// genuinely conflicts" — so a transient network blip right after a
// successful conditional write causes the library's own hidden retry to
// receive a stale-precondition error, which then trips updateStore()'s own
// retry loop into re-running the whole update a second time on top of the
// write that already landed, silently duplicating it. This bit us for real:
// a batch of service-catalog writes each landed twice. Disabling autoRetry
// means transient errors surface immediately to our code instead of being
// retried invisibly underneath our own retry logic.
